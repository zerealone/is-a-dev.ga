A free sub-domain you can register and use!


## How do I register a sub-domain?
* [Fork](https://github.com/zerealone/is-a-dev.ga/fork) this github repository.
* Create a new JSON file in `./domains` directory called `your-sub-domain-that-you-want.json`
* Add to the JSON file this example (and replace the fields) :
```json
{
  "description": "example.is-a-dev.ga",
  "repo": "Your github repo link",
  "owner": {
    "username": "Your github username",
    "email": "your github mail that connected to your account",
    "note": "If you have any notes, feel free to write them here."
  },
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "CNAME record for me to add for the domain to point"
  }
}
```
* The domain and the details will reviewed and merged. (usually takes a few days)
* After merging, the changes will take effect under a day!
* And... That's it!
